# Femtasy Front End technical test

## Description

This is the technical assessment for a junior position in femtasy.

Write a front end application to show Star Wars content to the users.

## Goal

- Deliver a **production ready application**
- Provide all **tests** necessary to ensure the correctness of the application
- Provide any relevant **documentation**

## Frontend requirements

- The app will show a list of films consumed from [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)
- When a user clicks on an element of the film list, show the following information:
  - Film data
  - Director data
  - List of characters
- When a user clicks on a character, show its information
- Users can save a film as favorite
- Users can save a character as favorite

### Bonus

- Use SASS as CSS extension language
- Instrument your application (metrics, error tracking...)
- Deploy the application to a cloud provider
- Provide a docker file to launch the project

## Considerations

- Use a _mobile first_ approach
- Feel free to use any UI framework
- There is no need for pagination
- For films show:
  - Title
  - Director name
  - Description
  - Cover picture
  - List of characters
- For characters show:
  - Name
  - Gender
  - Home world
  - Description
  - Picture
